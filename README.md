# ü¶† COVID-19 Detection AI
An AI-powered project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

---

## üìä **Project Overview**
This project trains a CNN model to classify X-ray images into:
- COVID-19 Positive  
- COVID-19 Negative  
- Normal  

It uses **TensorFlow/Keras** for the model and visualizes accuracy/loss over epochs.
