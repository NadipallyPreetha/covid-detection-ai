# COVID-19 Detection Using CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing and visualization of X-ray images.
- CNN model training and evaluation.
- Accuracy and loss plot visualization.
- Model saving for future predictions.

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy:** 100% on test data (as per your test run).
- **Loss:** 0.88

## ⚙️ How to Run
